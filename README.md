# boron-chat

It's a chat app based on UDP communication, the frontend itself is written in `C++` using `raylib` for rendering and `clay` for layout, and the networking code is written in `Rust` using `cxx.rs` crate to generate C++ bindings for the rust code, the rust code uses the `renet` create for handling network communication efficiently.
